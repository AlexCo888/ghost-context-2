Ghost Context is a wallet-based discovery app. Our app helps users run analysis on NFTs held by any wallet address to summon a weighted list of kindred spirits based on the frequency of commonly held NFTs based on source-wallet collections.

## ü¶á Signal 

The app currently analyzes only ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs on Ethereum using Alchemy API endpoints. We‚Äôd like assistance building out this same logic for NFTs on Base given that we can‚Äôt integrate using Alchemy API. An ideal outcome from üíØBuilders would provide users the ability to surface ghost context generated by Onchain Summer! üü°

We also have processing bottlenecks with our current build due to the sheer volume of data-crunching and would welcome input from savvy builders on how to accelerate app performance even as we amp up complexity and offerings for ghost context analyses.

## ü™¨ Our Thesis

Why is surfacing ghost context infinitely interesting?

- It‚Äôs a cheat code unique to web3 for finding your connections on the red thread of fate.
- Ghosties‚Äîpreviously invisible kindred collectors, now made visible through surfaced ghost context‚Äîhave a high likelihood of being up to interesting stuff or curating high-affinity stuff that satisfies your thumbprint of curiosity.
- Getting your Ghostie Row (top kindred spirits) on your radar is destined to unveil pathways of inspiration in the future.
- Surfacing ghost context produces inexorable resonance across web3.

If none of the above proves true‚Ä¶yet, the latent possibility of meeting the minds in your Ghostie Row and experiencing hyperconnection might manifest something meaningful, like the phenomena of generating scenius, birthing a hyperculture, or contributing to chaos magic.

Your Ghostie Row may be the key to leveling up your own neuroplasticity and output, as these kindred collectors are motivated to act as force multipliers on your most meaningful work.

## Roadmap

- Organize NFTs by transfer time
- Integrate Web3 social handles into results (Farcaster, Lens)
- Integrate XMTP into results
- Add Base, Optimism, Zora, and Polygon chains
- Implement cross-chain NFT analysis
- Increase results from Top 20 to Top 150
- Facilitate wallet to wallet connections via double opt-in logic
- Deploy ability to run analysis with ‚ÄúOR‚Äù Boolean Operators e.g. run ghost context analysis on NFT X and Y OR NFT Z
- Notifications

## Current Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Ethers.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Alchemy API
- WalletConnect (Web3Modal) and Wagmi

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask for interacting with the dApp
- Alchemy API Keys
